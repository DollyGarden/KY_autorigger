How to install:
1)Put the folder 'KY_AutoRigger' and userSetup.py in this address in your PC:
  C:\Users\***\Documents\maya\2022\scripts
  *** is your username.
2)Restart maya2022.

Version: 12.03.23:
1)I modified the script which I created following a youtube tutorial before I attend this masterclass.
2)I added a shelf and button, made it autoloaded, simplified some code, added readme and introduction video, and fixed some mistakes I made before.
3)I still don't know how to control the joints's orientation. The controller of wrist and fingers was created following the joints' rotation, so their directions are quite strange.

Thanks for your help!
