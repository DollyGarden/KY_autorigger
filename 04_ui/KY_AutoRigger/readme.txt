Ver0.1.1:
1)Modified the script which I created following a youtube tutorial before I attend this masterclass.
2)Added a shelf and button, made it autoloaded, simplified some code, added readme and introduction video, and fixed some mistakes I made before.
3)I still don't know how to control the joints's orientation. The controller of wrist and fingers was created following the joints' rotation, so their directions are quite strange.

Ver 0.1.2:
1)Added Header.
2)Added docstring for some function.
3)Formatted the script to PEP8
4)Changed the variable and function name to the snake_case.
